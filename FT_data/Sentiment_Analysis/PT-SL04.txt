Here is a product review from a customer, which is delimited with triple backticks.

Product Name: CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB)
Review text: 
```
It's always a risk with pre-builts that upgrades may not work. This 64Gb memory (2x32) worked just fine in my Lenovo Legion T7 34IAZ7 gaming PC. I can't use it to it's full capacity due to the limitations of the OEM motherboard, but I've got the 64G headroom I was looking for.
